# Advent of Code 2023 in C#

This repository is a solution for my code for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). I'm learning C#/.NET and as opposed to being most terse or performant I'm focusing on using the various language features that C#/.NET offers (LINQ, Extension Methods etc.) as well as having a proper solution structure with tests and libraries.
